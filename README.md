## Hello Rust

This project was built for the [hello world](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html) section of 'the book'.

#### Create new Rust project using cargo

- We can create a project using `cargo new`.
- We can build a project using `cargo build`.
- We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.

## Create a Guessing Game

This project is being extended to also host the [guessing game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) section of 'the book'. In this part, youâ€™ll learn about let, match, methods, associated functions, using external crates, and more
the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
